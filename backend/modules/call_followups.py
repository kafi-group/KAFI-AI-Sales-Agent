"""Call follow-up situations for AI Sales Agents (Sara / Rayan).

A *situation group* ("Happy with current supplier", "Call couldn't be made", ...) holds one or
more email *drafts*. After a call the agent will pick the best situation + draft and send it
(later phase). This module is storage + CRUD only.

Tables are created on first use with CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, so it never touches the Alembic
chain or app boot, and every function opens its own short-lived connection.

`call_marks` holds the per-company "do not disturb" / "not interested" marks (data only for now:
nothing dials, skips or colours anything from it yet).
